"Hello everyone, I've developed a highly precise predictive machine learning model for Type-2 Diabetes. I've executed all stages of the data science lifecycle, including data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, data splitting, and model building. Employing algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Decision Tree, I achieved accuracy scores ranging from 90% to 96% through model evaluation using K-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, I've seamlessly deployed this user-friendly model using the Streamlit library for easy access and utilization."
