Hello, to Everyone., Here i am Build More precise predictive Machine learning model for Type - 2 Diabetes Dataset
here, I am perform Datascience lifecycle steps  Datacollection, Datapreprocessing, Exploratory data Analysis(EDA), Feature Selection, DataSplitting, Machine learning model building i am apply KNN, Linear Regression , LogisticRegression, Support Vector Classifier, and Dexision Tree(Algorithms),
and performing model Evaluation of all these model using K-fold crross Validation, And Deployment using Streamlit(User Friendly) Library to deploy My Predictive model.. my model scored above >=90 and <=96 Accuracy of my 4 model(KNN,LogisticRegression,D-tree,SVC)


And Deploy the Predictive model into Streamlit Cloud
This is link you can explore and Enjoy
